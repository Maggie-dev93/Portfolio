# Professional Portfolio Website

## Objective

To build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase your professional portfolio, including the projects you'll build throughout your Full-Stack Web Development Program, to your professional network and potential employers.

## User Goals

Your users should be able to view your professional portfolio website and navigate between web pages on both mobile and desktop.

## Key Features

- **Homepage**: A short introduction and link(s) to work examples.
- **About Page**: Key information about you as an individual, your relevant skills, and the tools or programming language(s) you use.
- **Work Examples**: A section with your work examples—either as part of your homepage (e.g., in a grid) or on a separate work page.
- **Contact Section**: Either as a section on each page (e.g., in the footer) or in a separate contact page.

## Technical Requirements

- The website must consist of at least 3 interconnected HTML pages.
- The website must use one external CSS file in which all styles are defined.
- The website must use either CSS variables or a CSS preprocessor.
- You shall not include any external CSS libraries that you didn’t write yourself.
- The website’s code must be hosted in a Git repository on GitHub.
- The website can be deployed on a server. (While we strongly recommend doing so, this isn’t mandatory, and you can remove your website from the free test server after you’ve completed the project.)
- All your code must be valid.
  - Your HTML files must pass validation on the [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
  - All colors used need to pass the AA Accessibility Guidelines.
- The website must work on the latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera browser versions as well as on IE11.
- The website must work on all screen sizes (including mobile and tablet) between 1920px and 320px in width.
- The website must work with keyboard, mouse, and touch inputs.
